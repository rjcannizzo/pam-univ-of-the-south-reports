There are two main objectives:

	I. remove the empty header rows at the top, total rows and any merged cells (fluff remover)
	II. University of the South report (two input files)
		A) create a 'consolidated report' (all locations) on tab 1
		B) report for individual location on separate tabs 
			note: remove items that have no sales (columns H thru M inclusive). The 'quantity' columns are H and K
		
III. a 'category database' mapping category (column A) to item # in column B for University of the South .


Examples:
	
	1) DQ Prop chart 11.5.21 - Generic Example.xlsx (DQ generic example)
	2) Univ of South Group July 2021.xlsx (use this file to create tab 1, the consolidated data for all locations)
	3) Univ of South Individual July 2021.xlsx (individual locations that need separation into individual tabs)
	4) Univ of South Example Desired Output.xlsx (desired output)
	
Warning:
	Univeristy of the South file structure is different from dairy queen:
		- merged cells in H6: M7
		- we need the header info from rows 6 and 7 for columns H thru M inclusive)
		- row 8 is the first location name
