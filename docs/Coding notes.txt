Creating Excel file with multiple sheets: ExcelWriter object

	To write to multiple sheets it is necessary to create an ExcelWriter object with a target file name, and specify a sheet in the file to write to.
	Multiple sheets may be written to by specifying unique sheet_name. With all data written to the file it is necessary to save the changes. 
	Note that creating an ExcelWriter object with a file name that already exists will result in the contents of the existing file being erased.
	
	Parameters
	
	if_sheet_exists{‘error’, ‘new’, ‘replace’}, default ‘error’

    How to behave when trying to write to a sheet that already exists (append mode only).
        error: raise a ValueError.
        new: Create a new sheet, with a name determined by the engine.
        replace: Delete the contents of the sheet before writing to it.
	
	Syntax:
