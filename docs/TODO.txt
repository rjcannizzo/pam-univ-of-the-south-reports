Manager function

PROBLEMS:
	group totals (tab 1) has no 'CW' column (cause: parse_row() doesn't work the same way for both files?!?!)
	tab 1 has floats in column 'Pack' column (this is not hte case with subsequnt tabs)
	



write Excel data as int or float where necessary
- ok to store as text: item #, Pack, MPC Code
- target the last 9 columns
- int columns: case quantity, split quantity

add categories to output

* Pandas reads float by default? Tweak 

Helper functions needed:
	- determine lines to skip (usually 7)
	- differentiate between 'group' and 'individual site' Excel files
